## Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a rich set of libraries that helps solve many programming problems including machine learning. Also, python programming is easy to learn.

## Installation

Anaconda

If you are primarily doing data science work, Anaconda is a good option. Anaconda is popular because it brings many of the tools used in data science and machine learning with just one install.

1. Search Anaconda on the browser and open the link with the address https://anaconda.org/ .
2. Download Anaconda from the Anaconda homepage by selecting the operating system configuration.
3. Install Anaconda.
4. Create your virtual python environment using the following commands on the conda command prompt.
  (base)$ pip install virtualenv
  (base)$ virtualenv -p /usr/env_path virtualenv_name
  (base)$ source virtualenv_name/bin/activate
  (virtualenv_name)$ pip install pandas
  (virtualenv_name)$ deactivate
5. Open Jupyter Notebook on your browser and start coding.

Another way to install python is to download appropriate Python executable as per your operating system from https://www.python.org/ website and install it in your system.
